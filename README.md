🚀 I have completed a Power BI Desktop project where I developed an interactive dashboard visualization for a fictional company named AdventureWorks(Manufacturer of cycling equipment) .Key aspects of the project included:

- 🔗 Connecting and transforming raw data into a structured format.
- 🔄 Building a relational data model to streamline data analysis.
- 📊 Creating calculated columns and measures using DAX.
- 🎨 Designing an interactive dashboard to visualize key data insights.

The dashboard includes several specialized views:

- 🌍 Map Dashboard: Provides geographical insights using map visualizations.
- 📦 Product Dashboard: Displays product performance and sales data.# AdventureWorks_PowerBi
